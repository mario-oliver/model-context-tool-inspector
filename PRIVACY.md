# Privacy Policy for WebMCP - Model Context Tool Inspector

**Last Updated:** August 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how the **WebMCP - Model Context Tool Inspector** Chrome extension ("the Extension", "we", "us", or "our") handles user information and data.

We are committed to respecting your privacy. The Extension is designed as a developer tool to inspect, monitor, and execute WebMCP tools (`document.modelContext`), and it operates with a privacy-first approach: **we do not collect, track, store, or sell any personal data.**

---

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

- **No Personal Identifiable Information (PII):** We do not collect names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, or any other identifying personal information.
- **No Browsing History or Analytics:** We do not track, log, or transmit your browsing history, web activity, or usage analytics.
- **No Telemetry or Tracking Pixels:** The Extension contains no third-party tracking code, analytics libraries, advertising trackers, or fingerprinting scripts.
- **No First-Party Server:** The extension does not communicate with any custom or developer-hosted backend servers.

---

## 2. Information Handled Locally

The Extension processes data locally within your browser to provide its developer inspection capabilities:

- **WebMCP Tool Metadata:** The content script inspects the active web page's `document.modelContext` API to read registered tool names, descriptions, input schemas, frame IDs, and tool annotations (such as `readOnlyHint`, `untrustedContentHint`, and `consequentialHint`). This information is displayed in the extension's side panel for inspection.
- **Tool Execution Data:** When you manually execute a tool or trigger tool execution via the AI assistant, the input parameters and execution results are passed directly between the extension and the web page/frame.
- **Local Storage (`localStorage`):** The following configuration settings are stored locally on your machine within the browser's extension storage:
  - **Gemini API Key:** If you provide a Google Gemini API key to enable AI features, it is stored locally in `localStorage.apiKey`. It is never transmitted anywhere other than directly to Google's Gemini API endpoints.
  - **Selected Model:** Your chosen Gemini model (e.g., `gemini-3.6-flash`) is saved in `localStorage.model`.
  - **Prompt Suggestion Preference:** Your preference for automatic prompt generation is saved in `localStorage.suggestUserPrompt`.
- **Clipboard Access:** The extension will only write data (such as tool definitions in JSON/ScriptToolConfig format or session debug traces) to your clipboard when you explicitly click the corresponding "Copy" buttons. The extension never reads from your clipboard.

## 3. Third-Party Services and Network Requests

The Extension does not transmit any data over the network by default.

### Google Gemini API

If and only if you provide a Gemini API key and use the AI interaction features (such as sending prompts or enabling prompt suggestions), the Extension communicates directly from your browser to Google's Gemini API endpoints (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com` via the official `@google/genai` library).

When using these features:

- Your user prompt, available tool declarations (names, descriptions, schemas), and tool execution results are transmitted to Google to process model responses and function calls.
- This data transfer is subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and the [Google APIs Terms of Service / Generative AI Additional Terms of Service](https://ai.google.dev/terms).
- If you do not provide an API key, no network requests to Google Gemini are made.

## 4. Permissions Used and Why

The Extension requests the following permissions in its `manifest.json`:

| Permission                        | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sidePanel`                       | Displays the Tool Inspector user interface in Chrome's side panel.                                                                                                         |
| `activeTab`                       | Grants temporary access to interact with the currently active tab to inspect and execute tools.                                                                            |
| `scripting`                       | Allows injecting the content scripts and frame resolution helpers required to communicate with `document.modelContext`.                                                    |
| `webNavigation`                   | Enumerates frame origins (`chrome.webNavigation.getAllFrames`) within the active tab to discover tools in embedded frames and update the tool badge count upon navigation. |
| `host_permissions` (`<all_urls>`) | Enables the extension to inject content scripts across any web page where developers are testing WebMCP tools.                                                             |

## 5. Data Retention and Security

- All settings and configuration data remain in your browser's local storage and can be deleted at any time by updating/clearing the API key in the extension UI, resetting local storage, or uninstalling the extension.
- Network communication with the Google Gemini API (when enabled) uses encrypted HTTPS/TLS connections.
